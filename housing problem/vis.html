                We are interested in the relationship between the annual household income and 
                the living expenses associated with the cost of households in any singular state. 
                We believe that overall the cost of living in the United States has increased to take 
                up a more significant portion of the income of the average American. We will include 
                different parameters such as the race of people, populations, population density, demographic 
                data, and a few other considerations to give a comprehensive analysis of the proposed topic. 
                We aim to show the differences across each US state for a single year. This will be done through 
                a variety of different maps, charts, and plots aimed at looking how the cost of living affects our 
                units of Americans in each state.
